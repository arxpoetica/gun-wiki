[![NPM downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/gun.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/gun) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/amark/gun.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/amark/gun) [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/amark/gun?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

GUN is a realtime, distributed, offline-first, graph database engine.

## But what makes gun **awesome**?

 - **Realtime** - GUN shares data across connected peers in real-time.  There's no need for plugins, extensions, or anything else, just use gun as directed and enjoy realtime data sharing.
 - **Distributed** - GUN is peer-to-peer by design and doesn't rely on a central data server.  This results in all kinds of data deliciousness, including being able to work offline by default.  Peers can be configured into more traditional centralized or federated systems, as appropriate for application needs.
 - **Graph** - All data in gun is encapsulated as nodes in a graph.  Graphs allow data to be related in traditional table formats, as well as tree format, and circular formats.  In other words, gun lets your data needs determine your data storage structure.

## Demos

 - [Example applications](http://gunjs.herokuapp.com/)
 - Running demos locally

   The examples included in this repo are online [here](http://gunjs.herokuapp.com/), you can run them locally by:

   ```bash
   npm install gun
   cd node_modules/gun
   node examples/http.js 8080
   ```

   Then visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser. If that did not work it is probably because npm installed it to a global directory. To fix that try `mkdir node_modules` in your desired directory and re-run the above commands. You also might have to add `sudo` in front of the commands.
