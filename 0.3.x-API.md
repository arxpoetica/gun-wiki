# Gun
Used to creates a new gun database instance.
```javascript
var db = new Gun(options)
```
> **note:** `Gun` works with or without the `new` operator.

## Options

 - `no params/undefined` creates a local datastore using the default persistence layer, either localStorage or a JSON file.

 - passing an `array` of URLs creates a local datastore, and attempts to sync it with each peer at the addresses.

   - when only syncing with a single peer, you can leave out the array, sending in just a `string`.

 - `{ peers, wire, uuid... }` the previous options are actually aggregated into an `object` under the hood.

   - `options.peers` is an object, where the URLs are properties, and the value is an empty object.

   - `options.wire` allows you to manually override module hooks for `put` and `get`
     (however, gun exposes a more streamlined approach for building extensions and modules).

   - `options.uuid` allows you to override the default 24 random alphanumeric soul generator with
      your own function.

   - `options['module name']` allows you to pass options to a 3rd party module. Their project README
     will likely list the exposed options.
     [Here is a list of such modules...](https://github.com/amark/gun/wiki#modules)

### Examples
Sync with one peer
```javascript
new Gun('http://yourdomain.com/gun')
```

Sync with many peers
```javascript
new Gun(['http://server1.com', 'http://server2.com'])
```

Working with modules
```javascript
new Gun({
  // Amazon S3 (comes bundled)
  s3: {
    key: '',
    secret: '',
    bucket: ''
  },

  // simple JSON persistence (bundled)
  // meant for ease of getting started
  file: 'file/path.json'
})
```

Advanced options
```javascript
new Gun({
  // set your own UUID function
  uuid: function () {...},

  // set your own get/put handlers
  wire: {
    get: getHandler,
    put: putHandler
  }
})
```
