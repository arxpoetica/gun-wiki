# Gun
Used to creates a new gun database instance.
```javascript
var db = new Gun(options)
```
> **note:** `Gun` works with or without the `new` operator.

## options

 - `undefined` creates a local datastore using the default persistence layer, either localStorage or a JSON file.

 - passing a `url` creates a local datastore, and attempts to sync it with the peer at that address.

   - to sync with multiple peers, instead send an array of URLs `['https://peer1.com', 'http://peer2.org']`.

   - `{ name: 'setting' }` the previous options are actually aggregated into an object under the hood.

     - `options.peers` is an object, where the URLs are properties, and the value is an empty object.

     - `options.wire` allows you to manually override module hooks for `put` and `get`
       (however, gun exposes a more streamlined approach for building extensions and modules).

     - `options.uuid` allows you to override the default 24 random alphanumeric soul generator with
        your own function.

     - `options['module name']` allows you to pass options to a 3rd party module. Their project README
       will likely list the exposed options.
       [Here is a list of such modules...](https://github.com/amark/gun/wiki#modules)

### examples
```javascript
// sync with one peer
new Gun('http://yourdomain.com/gun')

// sync with many peers
new Gun(['http://server1.com', 'http://server2.com'])

// more options
new Gun({
  // set your own UUID function
  uuid: function () {...},

  // set your own get/put handlers
  wire: {
    get: getHandler,
    put: putHandler
  },
})
```
