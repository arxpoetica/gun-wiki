Rough roadmap, subject to frequent change:

 - 0.6 was load testing

 - 0.7 is SEA (security, encryption, authorization)

 - 0.8 will probably be LRU/expiry with continuous load testing

 - 0.9 will probably be fixing some embarrassing things I'm cheating on

 - 1.0 celebration/documentation

 - 1.1 SQL for kicks

 - 1.2 Mango query
 
 - 1.3 WebRTC

 - 1.4 radix storage engine
