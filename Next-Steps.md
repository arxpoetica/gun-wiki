We have broken the documentation into several pages based on your needs:

## Application Developers

For people wanting to just get stuff done, you will want to start with:

1. Experiencing the [interactive tutorials](My-First-Todo-App).
2. Then working your way through the [guides](Crash-Course).
3. And then jumping into the [API documentation](API).

Finally, you will enjoy using many of the extensions to GUN, like the [.open](API#open) command. It makes building apps with GUN super easy!

## Software Architects

You may want to jump into GUN's engineering and decide whether it is a good fit for your company. We recommend you:

1. Get a sense for our [CAP Theorem tradeoffs](CAP-Theorem).
2. Review the [performance benchmarks](100000-ops-sec-in-IE6-on-2GB-Atom-CPU).
3. See how the [graphs are structured](GUN%E2%80%99s-Data-Format-%28JSON%29).
4. Understand how the [conflict resolution algorithm works](Conflict-Resolution-with-Guns).
5. [Recreate GUN from scratch](https://gun.eco/docs/Porting-GUN).

Hopefully this helps!
