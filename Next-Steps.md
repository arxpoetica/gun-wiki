 As mentioned before, gun supports circular references between data. Read this if you wanna know how it works.

 - **[CAP Theorem](https://gun.eco/docs/CAP-Theorem)**<br>
 The CAP Theorem says you there's Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance, and databases can only choose two. This page explains which gun chooses and why.

 - **[Conflict Resolution with Guns](https://gun.eco/docs/Conflict-Resolution-with-Guns)**<br>
 Since gun is offline-first in one of the harshest programming environments on earth (the browser), it's conflict resolution algorithm has to be rock-solid. This page gives a high-level overview.
