v0.1.0 is depreciated, but here are the old docs for it:

### 0.1.0 API and How to:

#### Basic [[Wire Protocol|Wire-Protocols-(v0.1.x)]] methods

#### Internals
- **set**, writes to `this._.node`, if `this._.keys` exists then links them to it.
- **key**, writes to `this._.keys`, if `this._.node` exists then links them to it.


- **load**, pulls `this._.node` in from cache or remote, via a key or a soul, and links.
- **get**, reads from `this._.field` on `this._.node` or the node itself.


**path** wraps load recursively, to traverse depth, and writes `this._.field`.

**on** emulates get, but over time as changes are made.

**map** wraps around parallel paths.

**blank** is a conditional which executes if the node from load is empty.

**insert** wraps around set, putting in objects without human friendly fields, may not stay in core.

#### Middleware Plugin Hooks
- **load**, is responsible for retrieving a node from non-memory storage. Whether it be from disk, peers, another database, or a cloud service, it all must conform to the following API.
    - **key**, _text or object_, your load hook will receive a key string (_"my/first/data"_) or a soul meta object (_{'#': 'UfAve0cVP1e51PE20hqpN8y9'}_) as the first parameter.
    - **function**, is a callback you need to pass the data too.
        - **err**, _error object_, a regular javascript object that has an `err` field on it.
        - **node**, _null or node_, if the object does not exist at this layer, return `null`, else return the node.
