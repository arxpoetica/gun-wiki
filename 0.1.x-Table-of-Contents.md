# 0.1.0 API and How to:

### Basic [[Wire Protocol|Wire-Protocols-(v0.1.x)]] methods

## Internals
- **set**, writes to `this._.node`, if `this._.keys` exists then links them to it.
- **key**, writes to `this._.keys`, if `this._.node` exists then links them to it.


- **load**, pulls `this._.node` in from cache or remote, via a key or a soul, and links.
- **get**, reads from `this._.field` on `this._.node` or the node itself.


**path** wraps load recursively, to traverse depth, and writes `this._.field`.

**on** emulates get, but over time as changes are made.

**map** wraps around parallel paths.

**blank** is a conditional which executes if the node from load is empty.

**insert** wraps around set, putting in objects without human friendly fields, may not stay in core.

## Middleware Plugin Hooks
- **load**, is responsible for retrieving a node from non-memory storage. Whether it be from disk, peers, another database, or a cloud service, it all must conform to the following API.
    - **key**, _text or object_, your load hook will receive a key string (_"my/first/data"_) or a soul meta object (_{'#': 'UfAve0cVP1e51PE20hqpN8y9'}_) as the first parameter.
    - **function**, is a callback you need to pass the data too.
        - **err**, _error object_, a regular javascript object that has an `err` field on it.
        - **node**, _null or node_, if the object does not exist at this layer, return `null`, else return the node.

### [[Setting Data|Setting-Data-(v0.1.x)]]


## Getting Data

Now that we've looked at setting values in gun, let's look at retrieving them again. For starters, let's go get Cecil out of the database. If you haven't gone over the setting values, [you probably want to start there](https://github.com/amark/gun/wiki/Setting-Data-%28v.0.1.0%29).

```javascript
gun.load('person/cecil').get(function(cecil) {
    console.log(cecil.location); // Prints `Night Vale` to the console
});
```

To explain the different methods going on here, `.load(__key__)` gives us access to a particular "key" in gun, and then `.get()` takes a callback that will have the value passed to it as a parameter. Once you've loaded a key, you can also tell gun to "step inside" that object and return an associated object. For example, we can easily get Khoshekh through Cecil by using `.path()`

```javascript
gun.load('person/cecil').path('cat').get(function(khoshekh) {
    console.log(khoshekh.species); // Prints `cat` to the console
});
```
