When we launched the MVP of GUN in February we got an overwhelmingly positive response. But the biggest thing that people wanted to see next was the ability to scan over their entire data set with queries. Now we're proud to announce that in the upcoming `0.2.x` release you'll be able to do just that with the new `.all` command.

The `.all` command is powerful enough that we will be able to support any query language on top of it, including SQL and MongoDB style query docs. To add such support, we had to refactor a large part of GUN because we had designed everything to be near O(1) in operations. Scanning over your entire data set is O(N) which is slow, but we're making some optimizations to make this better.

1. Most of the time you only want to scan over a subset of your data, like a particular table in SQL speak. However, since GUN is a graph database that supports both relational and document oriented data we cannot assume the pre-existence of a table. This is where Radix Trees become extraordinarily useful, despite being a seemingly CS101 level algorithm. Why? Because if you create a key of `'user/marknadal'`, the prefix `'user/'` becomes a natural lexical table or collection or folder. This allows you to create tables in an ad-hoc manner, but not suffer the performance penalty..
2. We were also forced to rethink how any JSON was blobbed, and as a result of refactor we can now support JSON of any arbitrary size. This is really exciting because you will be able to have infinitely growing lists, like an object that has a reference to every user in your system. Despite how large the object grows, GUN will be able to intelligently stream it out in realtime to peers, so you will not get any additional latency waiting for the object to complete its download before you can use it.

Overall, this demonstrates the importance of the feedback loop while building tools for programmers. Without your vital suggestions we might have locked ourselves into a slower system and one that would ultimately be less useful. That is why we are proud of this upcoming `0.2.x` release, because it incorporates your feedback into the database - making it better for all of us, SQL support and all.

Remember, you're just an `npm install gun` away from getting started! Check out http://gunDB.io and the README for some documentation - there isn't much, but we will be fixing that as well with the new release!
