Because of an overlap in words, establishing a precise vocabulary is important.

Example of conflict:

- _Node_ can refer to a node in a graph, a node in a network, or node as in NodeJS.
- _Set_ can refer to a set as in a subset, or the act of setting something in place.

Therefore, please conduct your language with the following semantics:

- **Group**, is an unordered collection of finite things.
- **Peer**, is a gun server that can be connected to.
- **Mesh**, is a group of one or more peers connected via some topology.
- **Partition**, is the disconnection of peers, forming a divergent mesh.
- **Value**, is a binary, number, text, or relation that exists as a singular whole.
- **Field**, is a symbol used to reference a value at any time.
- **Node**, a group of no, one, some, or all fields, as they change over time.
- **Graph**, a group of nodes. Different from a "graph node" which is a node itself.
- **Universe**, all nodes over all time over all meshes.

- **Put**, as a verb, is changing the values on a group of one or some fields, in a group of one or some nodes.
- **Key**, as a verb, creates an index trying to remember a group of one or some nodes.
- **Get**, as a verb, opens a key or brings a relation into cache, to start exploring a graph.
- **All**, as a verb, is a discovery mechanism for machines to find where keys, nodes, or peers are.

- **Stream**, the puts on a node over a series of divisible time.
- **State**, the stream on a node that a peer had at a certain time.
- **Sync**, exchanging states and streams between peers over time.
- **Save**, to snapshot the state of a one or some ndoes into storage by a peer.
- **Soul**, is the practically unique, immutable identifier for a node.
- **Send**, firing off a message into a mesh, irregularly repeated until sent.
- **Sent**, proof that a message was received, might contain data that needs no receipt.

- **On**, gives you the current node or value, and as they change.
- **Path**, navigate on a graph, via fields, by chaining relations together.
- **Map**, iterate on the fields in a graph and path into them.
- **Not**, notifies you that the node or value requested is not known.
- **Val**, attempts to gives you the node or value only once.
- **Set**, adds an item into a set of items, or adds the null set.
